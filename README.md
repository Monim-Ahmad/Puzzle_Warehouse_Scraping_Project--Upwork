# Puzzle Warehouse Scraping Project--Upwork

Client requirement was the name, price, and URL for every 100-piece puzzle of Puzzle Warehouse.

First of all, I checked the website's security and bot direction technologies. Then I started coding from scratch to build an efficient program. There were some challenges. It took some time. 

Then I checked my script 4 to 5 times before delivering it to clients. After every execution, I Checked the output file, and whether the dataset was well organized or not.
Finally, I'm satisfied with my script.

since I'm a new seller at Upwork I have done all of the above and then bid for the job. Unfortunately, the client already hired someone else for the job.
